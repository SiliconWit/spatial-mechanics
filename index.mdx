**Spatial Mechanics**, also called **3D Kinematics**, **Spatial Kinematics**, or **Three-Dimensional Mechanism Analysis**, is the branch of engineering that studies motion and force transmission in three-dimensional mechanical systems. This fundamental discipline provides the mathematical foundation for designing precise, reliable mechatronic systems from robotic arms to spacecraft attitude control systems.

This course explores how mechanical systems move and transmit forces in three-dimensional space‚Äîknowledge essential for designing sophisticated mechatronic systems that require precise spatial positioning and orientation control.
